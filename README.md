# Movie Review App

A modern Android application for browsing movies, viewing details, and adding reviews. This project was developed using Cursor AI as a learning exercise to understand modern Android development concepts and best practices.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates the implementation of various modern Android development concepts:

- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with Repository pattern
- **MVVM Architecture**: ViewModel and StateFlow for UI state management
- **Dependency Injection**: Using Hilt for dependency management
- **Paging 3**: Efficient loading and caching of movie lists
- **Room Database**: Local data persistence
- **Retrofit**: Network API calls
- **Coroutines & Flow**: Asynchronous programming
- **Material 3**: Modern Material Design implementation

## üìù Note

This project was developed using Cursor AI as a learning exercise. It's intended to demonstrate various Android development concepts and best practices. The code structure and implementation choices are made to showcase these concepts rather than for production use.

## üîë API Key

To run this project, you'll need to:
1. Get an API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
2. Replace the API key in `NetworkModule.kt`

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Add your TMDB API key
3. Build and run the project
